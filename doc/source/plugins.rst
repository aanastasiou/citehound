Working with plugins
====================

Citehound plugins provide a simple way to produce analytical results in different form, 
from the data held in Citehound.

Plugins are packaged and distributed as Python modules and they can have their own dependencies that are entirely separate from the main Citehound project itself.

This section of the documentation will cover the *usage of plugins*.

A different section will be devoted on the details of developing plugins for Citehound.
