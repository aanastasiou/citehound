Citehound comes with a list of very simple queries that you can run from the command line, to obtain data 
that answer some very simple questions such as:

* What is the distribution of publications per: 

  - Year
  - Author
  - Institution

* Which publications were:

  - Submitted within a particular year
  - Written by a particular author
  - Attributed to a particular institution

And others. 

These queries are stored in "query collections". There is a ``STD_QUERIES`` collection that 
contains quite a few queries to get you started and you can install your own
