Welcome to Citehound's documentation!
======================================

Citehound is a Python module that enables large scale analysis of bibliographical data.

If your literature review is of the order of a few thousand papers that fit your search criteria, 
Citehound can help you navigate, make sense of and track down the subset of papers that are more 
likely to help in your research.

Out of the box, Citehound has excellent support for Pubmed data, including full integration 
with the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and ROR datasets.

And, if you have access to other bibliogaphical data sources, Citehound can still be adapted to it 
via its unifying data model.
